Car Dealership System
📋 Description of the Project
This Java console application simulates a basic car dealership management system. Users can search for vehicles, add and remove inventory, and now (with Workshop 5) sell or lease vehicles to customers through contracts.

The system is built for small dealership operators who need a simple but structured way to manage vehicle data and customer transactions without a graphical interface.

The app stores vehicle inventory in a CSV file and generates contract records when a vehicle is sold or leased.



👤 User Stories
As a dealership employee, I want to search and filter vehicles by price, type, and more so I can assist customer inquiries.

As a salesperson, I want to record a vehicle sale or lease so that it’s saved and removed from inventory.

As a user, I want feedback in the terminal so I know my actions were successful.
